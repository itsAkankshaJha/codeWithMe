### ABOUT THIS PROJECT :sunglasses:
This is static portfolio webite made with **html ,css and bootstrap**.It is mobile optimised and fully responsive and has 8-10 html pages with a good styling .It is a beginner friendly project and its sole purpose is to push my learning in the field of web development.
I was able to make this project by reading the documentation of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and followed some courses on [UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/course/html-css-certification-course-for-beginners-e/learn/lecture/21106896?start=0#overview).
